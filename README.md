# Decentralized Loyalty Points Network

A blockchain-based loyalty points management system enabling seamless point issuance, redemption, and cross-program transfers through smart contracts.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized loyalty points network that allows businesses to create, manage, and analyze customer loyalty programs. The system facilitates point transfers between different loyalty programs while maintaining transparency and security.

## System Architecture

The network consists of four primary smart contracts:

### Points Issuance Contract
Manages the creation and distribution of loyalty points:
- Point minting with configurable parameters
- Automated point distribution rules
- Points expiration management
- Transaction verification and validation
- Multi-signature point issuance for security

### Redemption Contract
Handles the exchange of points for rewards:
- Real-time point balance verification
- Reward catalog management
- Redemption rules and restrictions
- Automated reward fulfillment
- Transaction history tracking

### Coalition Contract
Enables interoperability between different loyalty programs:
- Cross-program point transfer protocols
- Exchange rate management
- Partner program integration
- Settlement mechanisms
- Dispute resolution system

### Analytics Contract
Provides program insights and reporting:
- Customer engagement metrics
- Redemption pattern analysis
- Program performance tracking
- Predictive analytics
- Custom report generation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum development environment (Hardhat/Truffle)
- Node.js version 16 or higher
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- API keys for external integrations

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/loyalty-network.git
cd loyalty-network
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

4. Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```

## Usage

### For Program Administrators
1. Initialize loyalty program parameters
2. Set point issuance rules
3. Configure reward catalog
4. Manage coalition partnerships

### For Merchants
1. Connect to the network
2. Issue points to customers
3. Process redemptions
4. Access analytics dashboard

### For Customers
1. Create digital wallet
2. Earn and track points
3. Redeem rewards
4. Transfer points between programs

## Smart Contract Interaction

### Points Issuance
```solidity
function issuePoints(address _to, uint256 _amount) external;
function setIssuanceRules(Rules memory _rules) external;
function getPointBalance(address _user) external view returns (uint256);
function checkPointsExpiry(address _user) external view returns (ExpiryInfo[] memory);
```

### Redemption
```solidity
function redeemPoints(uint256 _rewardId, uint256 _amount) external;
function addReward(Reward memory _reward) external;
function getRewardCatalog() external view returns (Reward[] memory);
function getRedemptionHistory(address _user) external view returns (Redemption[] memory);
```

### Coalition
```solidity
function registerPartner(address _partner, ExchangeRate memory _rate) external;
function transferPoints(address _to, uint256 _amount, uint256 _programId) external;
function getExchangeRate(uint256 _fromProgram, uint256 _toProgram) external view returns (uint256);
```

### Analytics
```solidity
function generateReport(uint256 _reportType) external returns (Report memory);
function trackEngagement(address _user, Action memory _action) external;
function getProgramMetrics() external view returns (Metrics memory);
```

## Security Features

- Role-based access control
- Point issuance limits
- Anti-fraud mechanisms
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated auditing
- Secure point transfer protocols

## Integration Guidelines

### API Integration
```javascript
const LoyaltyNetwork = require('@loyalty-network/sdk');

// Initialize network connection
const network = new LoyaltyNetwork({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  network: 'mainnet'
});

// Issue points
await network.issuePoints({
  userId: 'user123',
  amount: 1000,
  expiryDate: '2025-12-31'
});
```
